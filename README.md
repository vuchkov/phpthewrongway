# Welcome #

In the world of PHP programming a set of trends are massively being propagated by some people (in their books and on websites) as "Modern PHP" while all other approaches are frowned upon as backwards, stupid, or just plain wrong.

These people seem to work tirelessly at getting other people to follow their way of doing things.

This is the Github repository for the website [PHP - The Wrong Way](http://www.phpthewrongway.com) that has been created in an attempt to present a pragmatic view on PHP programming. A view dictated by experience and practical consequence rather than popular trends, theory, or academic dogma.

The website is a living document and will continue to be updated with more information as it become available.

Feel free to participate!
